To investigate the flight dynamics of avian species, prior studies have employed optical motion capture systems to obtain indoor wingbeat motion data of birds for simulation and analysis. However, these systems are often constrained by site limitations and high costs. Recently, studies have attempted to acquire basic wingbeat data, such as wing beat rate, by installing single IMUs on birds. Nonetheless, a significant research gap remains in the development of a multi-IMU bio-logging device capable of comprehensively capturing the complete wingbeat motion of birds without any space limitations.

To address this deficiency, this project aims to design a simple wearable sensor system based on four IMUs for human walking pattern recognition. Simultaneously, a front-end displaying engine based on an external Java graphic library is also developed to create a digital representation of humans. As a result, the final digital twin could achieve motion-following within an acceptable latency. Although the technology will be initially tested on humans, it has the potential to track the motion and behaviour of animals, drawing inspiration from the elegant designs observed in nature.
