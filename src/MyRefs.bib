    abstract = {In this paper we describe a physics-based method for synthesis of bird ﬂight animations. Our method computes a realistic set of wingbeats that enables a bird to follow the speciﬁed trajectory. We model the bird as an articulated skeleton with elastically deformable feathers. The bird motion is created by applying joint torques and aerodynamic forces over time in a forward dynamics simulation. We solve for each wingbeat motion separately by optimizing for wingbeat parameters that create the most natural motion. The ﬁnal animation is constructed by concatenating a series of optimal wingbeats. This detailed bird ﬂight model enables us to produce ﬂight motions of different birds performing a variety of maneuvers including taking off, cruising, rapidly descending, turning, and landing.},

    abstract = {Bird ﬂight is a remarkable adaptation that has allowed the approximately 10 000 extant species to colonize all terrestrial habitats on earth including high elevations, polar regions, distant islands, arid deserts, and many others. Birds exhibit numerous physiological and biomechanical adaptations for ﬂight. Although bird ﬂight is often studied at the level of aerodynamics, morphology, wingbeat kinematics, muscle activity, or sensory guidance independently, in reality these systems are naturally integrated. There has been an abundance of new studies in these mechanistic aspects of avian biology but comparatively less recent work on the physiological ecology of avian ﬂight. Here we review research at the interface of the systems used in ﬂight control and discuss several common themes. Modulation of aerodynamic forces to respond to different challenges is driven by three primary mechanisms: wing velocity about the shoulder, shape within the wing, and angle of attack. For birds that ﬂap, the distinction between velocity and shape modulation synthesizes diverse studies in morphology, wing motion, and motor control. Recently developed tools for studying bird ﬂight are inﬂuencing multiple areas of investigation, and in particular the role of sensory systems in ﬂight control. How sensory information is transformed into motor commands in the avian brain remains, however, a largely unexplored frontier.},

    abstract = {Migration is a task that implies a route, a goal and a period of time. To achieve this task, it requires orientation abilities to ﬁnd the goal and energy to cover the distance. Completing such a journey by ﬂying through a moving airspace makes this relatively simple task rather complex. On the one hand birds have to avoid wind drift or have to compensate for displacements to reach the expected goal. On the other hand ﬂight costs make up a large proportion of energy expenditure during migration and, consequently, have a decisive impact on the refuelling requirements and the time needed for migration. As wind speeds are of the same order of magnitude as birds’ air speeds, ﬂight costs can easily be doubled or, conversely, halved by wind eﬀects. Many studies have investigated how birds should or actually do react to winds aloft, how they avoid additional costs or how they proﬁt from the winds for their journeys. This review brings together numerous theoretical and empirical studies investigating the ﬂight behaviour of migratory birds in relation to the wind. The results of these studies corroborate that birds select for favourable wind conditions both at departure and aloft to save energy and that for some long-distance migrants a tail-wind is an indispensable support to cover large barriers. Compensation of lateral wind drift seems to vary between age classes, depending on their orientation capacities, and probably between species or populations, due to the variety of winds they face en route. In addition, it is discussed how birds might measure winds aloft, and how ﬂight behaviour with respect to wind shall be tested with ﬁeld data.},

    abstract = {An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, ‘‘Ethographer’’. We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors.},

    abstract = {For many animal species that are difﬁcult to access, the behaviour of free-ranging individuals cannot be assessed by direct observation. In order to remedy this, we developed a new technique using a motion detector (acceleration data-logger) for monitoring the activity and behaviour of free-ranging vertebrates and tested its efﬁciency on a domestic cat, Felis catus. A total of 3615 min of surging acceleration was measured along the longitudinal body axis of an adult male cat. The cat’s behaviour was also ﬁlmed for 113 min, these video data being used to correlate the logger’s signals with the cat’s behaviour. Acceleration data-loggers attached on the cat’s collar recorded acceleration signals which were inﬂuenced by both the gravitational acceleration resulting from the body posture and the dynamic acceleration resulting from the dynamic behaviour of the cat. By applying spectral analysis based on a fast Fourier Transform to acceleration signals, body postures and some of the dynamic behaviours of the cat such as drinking, eating, and several paces of travelling were efﬁciently determined. The present study shows that acceleration data-loggers represent a useful and reliable system for accurately recording the activities and detail behaviours of the terrestrial animals.},

In this work we show how tri-axial acceleration can be used to identify some of the behaviours of imperial cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps. Based on the assessment of tri-axial acceleration signals, the following behaviours were identified in free-living birds: standing, sitting, floating on water, flying, walking and diving. During diving, the descent, bottom and ascent phases could be distinguished. We considered the factors which coded for the different behaviours and this allowed us to design a key that will allow researchers assessing tri-axial accelerometry data to identify some of the behaviours that imperial cormorants perform.},
