\begin{abstract}
\parindent
Previous research on avian flight dynamics has utilized optical motion capture systems for birds to collect their indoor wingbeat motion data for simulation and analysis. However, these systems are limited by site constraints. To overcome this limitation, recent studies have focused on installing single IMUs on birds to acquire basic wingbeat data without space limitations. Despite these efforts, there is still a significant research gap in developing a multi-IMU bio-logging device capable of comprehensively capturing the complete wingbeat motion of birds.
To address this deficiency, this project aims to design a simple wearable sensor system based on four IMUs for human walking pattern recognition. Additionally, a front-end displaying engine based on an external Java graphic library was also developed to create a digital representation of humans, which enables a motion-following functionality. Although the technology will be initially tested on humans, the technology could then be applicable to tracking the motion and behaviour of animals in order to learn from the elegant designs seen in the natural world.
